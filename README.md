5 Things You Should Know While Hiring AR/VR Developers
The choice to hire AR/VR developers is as tough like never before and, if we take into account that both AR and VR will get even more popular in the future, it will be even tougher to choose virtual and augmented reality developer.
Hiring in these two trades is challenging for a number of reasons. First of all, the market is still in the beginning stages. The current market has only taken off in the last 2–3 years, which means a lot of roles are opening up in start-ups and mid-level companies. 

Generally, the software developers for VR, and now AR, have come from the Games trade. This already small industry is now fragmenting with the addition of these platforms. The demand in the Games industry for Unity, Unreal and other engine programmers have always been high. In order to compound this demand, new companies fighting to bring developers into AR and VR creates a scarcity of talent, making hiring all that more difficult.
Even though finding and hiring best AR/VR developers is difficult as we mentioned above, let’s take a look at some guidelines you can use which help you to hire AR/VR Developers:

Skills Required:

One of the main reasons it is so hard to find quality work is because there are many skills both AR and VR developers need to have. AR developers mainly need a mixture of advanced computer vision skills, 3D modeling and desktop, web or mobile programming. A grip of 3D modeling should insert texturing, shading and rendering.
Preferred programming languages can vary according to the platform but most probably C++, C# or similar languages.
Most important point is that AR developers should have a passion for pushing the boundaries of new technologies. Keeping up-to-date of new research in the field is a must 

Ask to See a Proof of Concept:

One of the ways developers try to make an impact and stand out from their peers is to build something that can serve as a portfolio. 
When we discuss on both virtual reality and augmented reality, seeing really is believing. That’s why you should ask your first question if you can see a proof of concept (POC) app. The proof of concept might be a little awkward around the edges, but that’s to be expected. 

Search for Vertical Business Expertise:

While AR and VR tech can require expertise when it comes to building an application, you need to look beyond fundamental expertise in augmented or virtual reality development. 
Find a developer who validated experience in your specific business vertical or solving for a similar challenge in an associated vertical. Gaming is a big parting from retail, for example. Logistics is miles spread from toys. While VR has particular technical challenges, the same thing is true for business verticals. 
If you choose a developer without relevant vertical knowledge, you are starting from scratch instead of taking benefit of existing reusable expertise. This can drag out the development process and put your project at risk.

Avoid Device Obsessed VR/AR Developers

Each device has its own Pros and Cons and right now none of them provide an entire solution independently. If you put the device first, you can emerge as with a highly priced custom app that isn’t portable, may be outmoded or unsupported in a few months and can’t be repurposed down the road. 
Keep in mind that devices are simply publishing platforms and delivery mechanisms for content. For many companies, the best device for testing VR and AR concepts quickly and broadly may be a smartphone or tablet rather than an emerging wearable. You really don’t want to hire a developer with a fixation on “which device” or even “which tech”, “e,g, AR vs. VR”. Find someone who wants to discover and develop your business and make recommendations that make sense given the particular objectives of your project.

Creating and Managing 3D Content Should Be the Priority

Continuing the discussion about content, experienced developers will always put content first, not the device. If your business is focused on user experience, then start with the foundation of the experience – the content. This investment is timeless and once the content is created in 3D and managed, it can effortlessly be tailored to different devices as part of a more comprehensive customer experience. Placing 3D content first and making the content flexible, relational and manageable is the best way to protect an investment in AR and VR.
